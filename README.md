# Networking Web UI
A website built to do basic networking calls and functionality for secure networking - Ping, Host Lookup (ARP), TraceRoute, Etc.

## What the project does:
This web UI will be built for the purpose of running basic networking diagnostics and sytem checks such as:
•	Ping a host by IP address
•	TCPDump – watching for traffic on a specific network
•	Trace Route
•	DNS Look-Up
•	Host List (ARP Table)
•	Scan Network – scan by VLAN, return listing of host profiles

## Why the project is useful:
Within a system of separate, secure networks, a company's IT department will be able to securly access and check the above within a particular network without having to reach out to the network owners, while keeping security intact.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project:
Maintained and contributed to by Daniel Hopps
