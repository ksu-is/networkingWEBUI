# Networking Web UI
A website built to do basic networking calls and functionality for secure networking - Ping, Host Lookup (ARP), TraceRoute, Etc.

## What the project does
This web UI will be built for the purpose of running basic networking diagnostics and sytem checks such as:\
•	Ping a host by IP address\
•	TCPDump – watching for traffic on a specific network\
•	Trace Route\
•	DNS Look-Up\
•	Host List (ARP Table)\
•	Scan Network – scan by VLAN, return listing of host profiles\

## Why the project is useful
Within a system of separate, secure networks, a company's IT department will be able to securly access and check the above within a particular network without having to reach out to the network owners, while keeping security intact.
